# Task Description
You will analyze trajectories for potential errors and provide analysis in a standardized format.

# Analysis Rules
1. Focus on Error Detection: Analyze each step in the trajectory to identify errors, regardless of the current task status.

2. Analysis Method:
    - Start from the final outcome
    - Work backwards through each action
    - Identify where the trajectory first deviated from correct behavior

3. Required Checks:
    - Verify that you have reached the correct location before picking up objects
    - Confirm destination exists in the environment before navigation
    - If the action 'go to [location]' results in 'Nothing happens', it means you are already at that location or the location doesn't exist in the environment

4. Output Must Include:
    - "** Error Location **": Specific step where error occurred
    - "** Explanation **": Error explanation and correction method
