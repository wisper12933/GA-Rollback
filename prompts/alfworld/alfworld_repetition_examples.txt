# Task Description
You will analyze trajectories for potential errors and provide analysis in a standardized format.

# Analysis Rules
1. Focus on Error Detection: Analyze each step in the trajectory to identify errors, regardless of the current task status.

2. Analysis Method:
    - Start from the final outcome
    - Work backwards through each action
    - Identify where the trajectory first deviated from correct behavior

3. Required Checks:
    - Verify that you have reached the correct location before picking up objects
    - Confirm destination exists in the environment before navigation

4. Output Must Include:
    - "** Error Location **": Specific step where error occurred
    - "** Explanation **": Error explanation and correction method

# Example Cases
## Analysis Example 1
### Trajectory
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a countertop 1, a garbagecan 1, a handtowelholder 2, a handtowelholder 1, a sinkbasin 2, a sinkbasin 1, a toilet 1, a toiletpaperhanger 1, and a towelholder 1.
Your task is to: clean some soapbar and put it in countertop.
Act 1: go to cabinet 1
Obs 1: The cabinet 1 is closed.
Act 2: open cabinet 1
Obs 2: You open the cabinet 1. The cabinet 1 is open. In it, you see a cloth 1.
Act 3: go to cabinet 2
Obs 3: The cabinet 2 is closed.
Act 4: open cabinet 2
Obs 4: You open the cabinet 2. The cabinet 2 is open. In it, you see nothing.
Act 5: go to cabinet 3
Obs 5: The cabinet 3 is closed.
Act 6: open cabinet 3
Obs 6: You open the cabinet 3. The cabinet 3 is open. In it, you see a candle 1, and a toiletpaper 3.
Act 7: go to cabinet 4
Obs 7: The cabinet 4 is closed.
Act 8: open cabinet 4
Obs 8: You open the cabinet 4. The cabinet 4 is open. In it, you see a soapbottle 1, and a toiletpaper 2.
Act 9: go to sinkbasin 1
Obs 9: On the sinkbasin 1, you see nothing.
Act 10: go to sinkbasin 1
Obs 10: Nothing happens.

### Analysis
Let's analyze it step by step from back to front.
Obs 10 shows that Act 10 is invalid.
Act 10 repeats the action of Act 9, and it is incorrect. I should go to sinkbasin 2 and other places to find a soapbar.

### Conclusion
** 1 Error Location **: Act 10
** 2 Explanation **: I already went to sinkbasin 1, there is nothing. I should go to sinkbasin 2 and other places.

## Analysis Example 2

### Analysis
Let's analyze it step by step from back to front.
Obs 11 shows that Act 11 is invalid.
Act 11 repeats the action of Act 10, and it is incorrect.
Obs 10 shows that Act 10 is invalid.
Act 10 is incorrect, because I didn't have a cd 2 with me. I should first take cd 2 from desk 1.
