# Task Description
Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24.

# Rules
1. Before making your choice, you should evaluate the current situation and plan your next moves.
2. Choose two numbers from the remaining ones and apply one of these operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), or division (/).
3. When observation shows that there is only one number, 24, you should give a complete expression for that number that uses only the four numbers in the input. Such as "answer: (6 - 4) * (4 + 8) = 24".

# Here are 5 examples.

## Example 1
Input: 4 4 6 8
Act 1> think: The numbers entered are all even numbers. Let me try combining numbers first to see if I can get close to 24.
Obs 1> OK.
Act 2> 4 + 8 = 12
Obs 2> numbers left: 4 6 12
Act 3> think: Now I can try subtracting 4 from 6 to get 2. And multiplying 2 by 12 gives us 24.
Act 3> OK.
Act 4> 6 - 4 = 2
Obs 4> numbers left: 2 12
Act 5> 2 * 12 = 24
Obs 5> numbers left: 24
Act 6> think: The complete calculation expression should be: (6 - 4) * (4 + 8) = 24.
Obs 6> OK.
Act 7> answer: (6 - 4) * (4 + 8) = 24
Obs 7> Success!

## Example 2
Input: 2 9 10 12
Act 1> think: I have numbers 2, 9, 10, and 12. Looking at these numbers, I notice 12 and 2 could multiply to get 24 directly.
Obs 1> OK.
Act 2>12 * 2 = 24
Obs 2> numbers left: 9 10 24
Act 3> think: Now I have 9, 10 and 24. If I can get 1 from 9 and 10, I can multiply it with 24.
Obs 3> OK.
Act 4> 10 - 9 = 1
Obs 4> numbers left: 1 24
Act 5> 24 * 1 = 24
Obs 5> numbers left: 24
Act 6> think: The complete expression should be: (12 * 2) * (10 - 9) = 24.
Obs 6> OK.
Act 7> answer: (12 * 2) * (10 - 9) = 24
Obs 7> Success!

## Example 3
Input: 4 9 10 13
Act 1> think: Looking at numbers 4, 9, 10, and 13. I can try getting a small number first by subtracting 10 from 13.
Obs 1> OK.
Act 2> 13 - 10 = 3
Obs 2> numbers left: 3 4 9
Act 3> think: Now with 3, 4, and 9, I notice I can subtract 3 from 9 to get 6.
Obs 3> OK.
Act 4> 9 - 3 = 6
Obs 4> left: 4 6
Act 5> think: Now I have 4 and 6, which can multiply to get 24.
Obs 5> OK.
Act 6> 4 * 6 = 24
Obs 6> numbers left: 24
Act 7: think: The complete expression should be: 4 * (9 - (13 - 10)) = 24.
Obs 7: OK.
Act 8> answer: 4 * (9 - (13 - 10)) = 24
Obs 8> Success!

## Example 4
Input: 1 4 8 8
Act 1> think: Looking at numbers 1, 4, 8, and 8. I notice I can divide 8 by 4 to get a small number first.
Obs 1> OK.
Act 2> 8 / 4 = 2
Obs 2> numbers left: 1 2 8
Act 3> think: Now I have 1, 2, and 8. I can add 1 and 2 to get 3, which could be a good factor for 24. Then, 3 and 8 can multiply to get 24.
Obs 3> OK.
Act 4> 1 + 2 = 3
Obs 4> numbers left: 3 8
Act 5> 3 * 8 = 24
Obs 5> numbers left: 24
Act 6> think: The complete expression should be: (1 + 8 / 4) * 8 = 24.
Obs 6> OK.
Act 7> answer: (1 + 8 / 4) * 8 = 24
Obs 7> Success!

## Example 5
Input: 5 5 5 9
Act 1> think: I see three 5s and a 9. Obviously, adding them together gives 24. Add two 5s first to get 10.
Obs 1> OK.
Act 2> 5 + 5 = 10
Obs 2> numbers left: 5 9 10
Act 3> 10 + 5 = 15
Obs 3> left: 9 15
Act 4> 15 + 9 = 24
Obs 4> left: 24
Act 5> think: The complete expression should be: ((5 + 5) + 5) + 9 = 24.
Obs 5> OK.
Act 6> answer: ((5 + 5) + 5) + 9 = 24
Obs 6> Success!
