Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. Each step, you are only allowed to choose two of the remaining numbers to obtain a new number.
Input: 2 12 13 13
Act 1> 13 - 12 = 1
Obs 1> numbers left: 1 13 2
Act 2> 13 - 1 = 12
Obs 2> numbers left: 12 2
Act 3> 12 * 2 = 24
Obs 3> numbers left: 24
Act 4> 24 = 24
Obs 4> All available numbers have been consumed. Please provide the final arithmetic expression, which should start with "answer: ", such as: “answer: (6 - 4) * (4 + 8) = 24”
Act 5> think: The complete expression should be: (13 - 12) * (13 - 1) = 24.
Obs 5> OK.
Act 6> answer: (13 - 12) * (13 - 1) = 24
Obs 6> The numbers in the math expression do not match the numbers in the problem!
Act 7> 13 - 12 = 1
Obs 7> Exceeded the allowed number of steps.
STATUS: FAIL
New plan> My steps were technically correct until Act 5, but I made a critical error in writing the final expression. The correct expression should have used both 13s from the input and referenced all operations: "answer: (13 - (13 - 12)) * 2 = 24". The key is to track both instances of 13 in the final expression and ensure all original input numbers are used exactly once.

Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. Each step, you are only allowed to choose two of the remaining numbers to obtain a new number.
Input: 1 2 4 8
Act 1> 8 / 2 = 4
Obs 1> numbers left: 1 4 4
Act 2> 4 * 4 = 16
Obs 2> numbers left: 1 16
Act 3> 16 + 1 = 17
Obs 3> numbers left: 17
Act 4> 17 is not equal to 24, so let's try another approach.
Obs 4> All available numbers have been consumed. Please provide the final arithmetic expression, which should start with "answer: ", such as: “answer: (6 - 4) * (4 + 8) = 24”
Act 5> 8 * 2 = 16
Obs 5> All available numbers have been consumed. Please provide the final arithmetic expression, which should start with "answer: ", such as: “answer: (6 - 4) * (4 + 8) = 24”
Act 6> 16 + 4 = 20
Obs 6> All available numbers have been consumed. Please provide the final arithmetic expression, which should start with "answer: ", such as: “answer: (6 - 4) * (4 + 8) = 24”
Act 7> 20 + 1 = 21
Obs 7> All available numbers have been consumed. Please provide the final arithmetic expression, which should start with "answer: ", such as: “answer: (6 - 4) * (4 + 8) = 24”
Act 8> 21 is not equal to 24, so let's try another approach.
Obs 8> All available numbers have been consumed. Please provide the final arithmetic expression, which should start with "answer: ", such as: “answer: (6 - 4) * (4 + 8) = 24”
Act 9> 8 * 4 = 32
Obs 9> All available numbers have been consumed. Please provide the final arithmetic expression, which should start with "answer: ", such as: “answer: (6 - 4) * (4 + 8) = 24”
STATUS: FAIL
New plan> Look for ways to combine smaller numbers first (1 and 4 / 2) to create a useful multiplier for 8. Recognize that 4 / 2 = 2, so 1 + 4 / 2 = 3 creates an effective multiplier. Multiply (1 + 4 / 2) by 8 to reach 24. Express final answer as "answer: (1 + 4 / 2) * 8 = 24".
