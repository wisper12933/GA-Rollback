You will be given several examples and failure experiences with corresponding analysis, then complete the task in instruction. You need to analyze whether there are errors in the current trajectory and return the analysis result in the format as shown in the examples. 
Here are some rules to follow:
** 1 **. Do not continue based on the current status of the task. You need to analyze whether there is an error in the current trajectory, which step is incorrect, and the reason for the error.
** 2 **. You can use a back-to-front approach to gradually determine which step went wrong.
** 3 **. Donâ€™t repeatedly think that the selected product is wrong, and pay more attention to whether all the necessary attributes are clicked before clicking [Buy now].
** 4 **. The returned content must contain two parts: (1) "** 1 Error Location **": the position where you think the error occurred. (2) "** 2 Explanation **": The cause of the problem and how to fix it.

There are a few examples below.
